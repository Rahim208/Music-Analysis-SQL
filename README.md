Music Analysis using SQL pgAdmin4

Overview
This project involves analyzing music data using SQL queries in pgAdmin4. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, focusing on various aspects such as genre popularity, artist performance, and listener demographics.

Introduction
In the digital age, music data is abundant, and analyzing this data can provide valuable insights into trends and preferences. This project utilizes SQL to perform a detailed analysis of a music dataset, allowing us to answer key questions about the music industry.

Prerequisites
PostgreSQL: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine.
pgAdmin4: This tool will be used for database management and executing SQL queries.
Basic SQL Knowledge: Familiarity with SQL syntax and commands will be beneficial.

Analysis Overview
Data Sources: The dataset includes information on songs, artists, genres, and listener statistics.

Objectives:
Identify the most popular music genres.
Analyze trends in artist performance over the years.
Explore listener demographics and preferences.

SQL Queries
Here are some key SQL queries used in the analysis:

Most Popular Genres:

SELECT genre, COUNT(*) AS genre_count
FROM songs
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY genre_count DESC;

Artist Performance Over Time:

SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS song_count, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM release_date) AS release_year
FROM songs
GROUP BY artist, release_year
ORDER BY release_year, song_count DESC;

Listener Demographics:


SELECT age_group, COUNT(*) AS listener_count
FROM listeners
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY listener_count DESC;

Results

Genre Analysis: The analysis revealed that pop and rock are the most popular genres among listeners.
Artist Trends: Certain artists have shown a significant increase in song releases over the past decade.
Demographic Insights: The majority of listeners fall within the 18-24 age group, indicating a younger audience preference.

Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into music trends and listener preferences. Future work could involve deeper analysis of streaming data and incorporating machine learning techniques for predictive analytics.
